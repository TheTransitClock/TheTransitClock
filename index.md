The Transit Clock is an open source transit information system. It's core function is to provide and analyze arrival predictions for transit systems.

It takes a [GTFS-realtime vehicle positions feed](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/guides/vehicle-positions) as input and produces a [GTFS-realtime trip updates feed](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/guides/trip-updates).
