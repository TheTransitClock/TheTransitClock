In 2020, Metro Transit has selected TheTransitClock to provide real-time information in the Twin Cities. This decision follows a month-long competition over 1,400 buses, where TheTransitClock was found to outperform the competition and to provide superior predictions during disruptions.

TheTransitClock is an open source transit information system. It's core function is to provide and analyze arrival predictions for transit systems. It takes a [GTFS-realtime vehicle positions](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/guides/vehicle-positions) feed as input and produces arrival predictions in a [GTFS-realtime trip updates](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/guides/trip-updates) feed. 

TheTransitClock is an extended open source version of the project formally know as Transitime. Uniquely, TheTransitClock runs an adaptive algorithm called a Kalman Filter capable of identifying unusual operating conditions (weather, traffic collision, etc.) and adjusting predictions accordingly.
